This Project is called Kisaan-Konnect, as the name says. This is a e-platform for farmers to sell their produce. This way farmers have direct connection with retailers without any intermediate person. This app is very similar to OLX, to make it unique we were trying to add some unique features like developing a machine learning model to this app where it shows the current market price of a certain product and also predict it's market price in future. Also, similar to OLX, retailer could bargain for suitable price to which the farmer can agree and the mode of communication between farmer and retailer for now is just contact no., which will be displayed on product page.
